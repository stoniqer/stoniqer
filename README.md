# Hi! I'm Ilnar, and I'm tryna make friends with data (it's complicated 😬)  

**Sleep-deprived Student | Python Addict | Perpetual Learner**  
*"Currently figuring out why my Random Forest has more depth than my life goals."*

### 🧑💻 Who Am I?  
A former frog-in-the-well who suddenly decided pivot tables are boring but neural nets are *~aesthetic~*.  
My current skills include:  
- Overfitting models like I overthink life choices  

**Life goal:** Build something my mom can brag about at family reunions. She still thinks "GPU" is a typo.

### 🎮 My "Masterpieces" (Term Used Loosely)

### 🧰 Toolbox of Chaos  

**Comfort Zone™:**  
Python (Pandas for fake productivity, NumPy for matrix identity crises)

### 🎯 2024 Bingo Card  
1. Fix the overfitting in my models (and my sleep schedule).

### 📚 Current Struggles  
- Watching "Intro to ML" videos at 2x speed while taking notes at 0.5x.  
- Pretending I understand regularization better than I understand taxes.  
- Debating if buying that $20 Kaggle course counts as "self-care".
